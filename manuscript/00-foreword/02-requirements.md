## Requirements

To get the most out of this book, you should be familiar with the basics of web development, which includes some knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will also need to be familiar with the term [API](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/), because it is discussed frequently. I encourage you to join the official [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for the book, to help or get help from others.

### Editor and Terminal

For the development environment, use a running editor or IDE and terminal (command line tool), and [follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/). It is adjusted for MacOS users, but you can find a Windows setup guide, too. There are lots of articles about setting up a web development environment for your OS.

### React

On the client-side, this book uses React to teach about GraphQL in JavaScript. My other book called The Road to learn React teaches you all the fundamentals about React. It also teaches you to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. The book is available for free and after having read The Road to learn React, you should possess all the knowledge to implement the GraphQL client-side application with this book.

### Node

On the server-side, this book uses Node with Express as library to teach about GraphQL in JavaScript. You don't need to know much about those technologies before using them for your first GraphQL powered applications. The book will guide you through the process of setting up a Node application with Express and shows you how to weave GraphQL into the mix. Afterward, you should be able to consume the GraphQL API provided by your server-side application in your client-side application.

### Node and NPM

You will need to have [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which are used to manage the libraries we'll use along the way. In this book, you will install external node packages via npm (node package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks. You can verify which node and npm versions you have in the command line. If you don't see output in the terminal, you will need to install node and npm. These are the versions used for this publication:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
node --version
*v10.11.0
npm --version
*v6.4.1
~~~~~~~~

If you read The Road to learn React, you should be familiar with the setup already, since it introduces the npm ecosystem as well.
