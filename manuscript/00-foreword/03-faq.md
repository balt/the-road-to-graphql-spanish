## FAQ

**Why does the book use React to teach about GraphQL?**

GraphQL is often used in modern applications to connect client and server applications. These applications are often built with solutions such as React, Angular and Vue. To teach about GraphQL, it makes sense to apply it in a real world context like React for your client application. I picked React because it has only a slim API and a good learning curve. It is only the view layer in your tech stack. You can learn about it in [The Road to learn React](https://roadtoreact.com). However, you can apply your learnings about GraphQL in other client-side applications, too.

**Why does it use Node/Express to teach about GraphQL?**

You can consume third-party GraphQL APIs with a client application, but you can also implement your own GraphQL API on the server-side. Since it is more efficient to stick to one programming language (JavaScript), I picked Node.js. Express.js is the most popular choice for Node.js applications, which is why I picked it over alternatives like Hapi or Koa.

**How do I get updates?**

I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive notification the book has changed, you can download a new version of it.

**How do I gain access to the source code projects?**

If you bought the complete course that grants access to the source code projects or any other add-on, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you bought the course other than [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, create an account on the platform, and then go to the Admin page and contact me with one of the email templates. After that I can unlock the course for you. If you haven't bought the complete course, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the other material.

**Can I get a copy of the book if I bought it on Amazon?**

If you have bought the book on Amazon, you may have seen that the book is available on my website too. Since I use Amazon as one way to monetize my often free content, I honestly thank you for your support and invite you to sign up on [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com). There you can write me an email (Admin page) about your purchase, so that I can unlock the whole course package for you. In addition, you can always download the latest ebook version of the book on the platform.

**How can I get help while reading the book?**

The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who want to follow along with fellow students and experienced readers. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. You might find that helping others learn programming helps you internalize your own lessons. If there are no other options, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?**

If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. Also, check the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/the-road-to-graphql/the-road-to-graphql/issues) or in the GitHub repositories of the applications you will build along the way to see if any solutions are listed for a specific issue. If your problem wasn't mentioned, open a new issue where you can explain your problem, provide a screenshot, and offer more details (e.g. book page, node version).

**What if I cannot afford the complete course?**

If you cannot afford the complete course but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student, or that the complete course would be too expensive in your country. I want to support any cause to improve diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority, or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?**

Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can open an issue on [GitHub](http://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-graphql) and express improvements to the technical aspects or the text content. You can also open pull requests on GitHub for documents or repositories.

**How do I support the project?**

If you find my lessons useful and would like to contribute, seek my website's [About Page](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) for information about how to offer support. It is also very helpful for my readers to spread the word about how my books helped them, so others might discover ways to improve their web development skillsets. Contributing through any of the provided channels gives me the freedom to create in-depth courses, and to continue offering free material.

**Is there a money back guarantee?**

Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please contact me directly to seek a refund.

**What's your motivation behind the book?**

I want to teach about this topic consistently. I often find materials online that don't receive updates, or only apply to a small part of a topic. Sometimes people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to provide this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. Also, I hope I can support the less fortunate with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). Recently, I've found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming, as it's a meaningful activity I prefer over any 9-to-5 job. I hope to continue this path in the future.
