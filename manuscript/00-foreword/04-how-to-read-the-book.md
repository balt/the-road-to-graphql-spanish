## How to read this book

No one has ever learned programming from reading a book. Programming is about practical experiences, and conquering challenges to strengthen your skills as a developer long-term. Paradigms like functional programming and object-oriented programming require more extensive practice to use practically. Complex concepts like state management in modern web applications and libraries like React and Express will take more than a weekend to master. You will only learn these concepts by practicing them consistently.

I want this book to provide you with more hands on experience and challenges to help you grow as a programmer. The challenges are meant to create a flow experience, a scenario where challenges are met by your skills and tools. If the book manages to keep the balance of challenging you and respecting your skill level, you might experience a [state of flow](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/). I found this insight astonishing when I read about it myself, so I hope I can induce it in this book.

### Tips & Tricks

As mentioned, there are practical tasks in the book, where you will be guided to solve problems using the techniques you learned in previous sections. It should let you experience practical uses for the lessons you've learned in these chapters, and provide deeper understanding of the more abstract content for your own projects.

Make sure to internalize each lesson before you continue with the next sections. The book is written in a way that the lessons build on the one before. Your knowledge of these topics scales horizontally using different techniques side-by-side, and vertically using technique-on-technique. Internalizing becomes much easier if you take notes as you move through the lessons. Consider writing down questions that aren't covered in the text so you can look them up afterward. These notes can also become feedback, which I use to improve future versions.

I encourage you to write the code examples out yourself instead of copy/pasting it. Typing out code teaches you how to find syntax errors and bugs, so you can fix errors on your own after you've moved on to trying the examples with your own data. Don't get discouraged if you encounter bugs, though. Bugs will usually appear in any application that gets complex enough, but it's acceptable to find them in learning scenarios because you'll have a chance to learn how to fix them.

The materials that follow should be absorbed with an IDE open to type out the examples and observe the output. I will provide additional tools like [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) that show how the code examples would function in real-world situations. Try to find time between the lessons to experiment with your own applications and apply the tools you've acquired. Without applying what you've learned in these chapters, you can never master them. If you are having difficulty coming up with project ideas, this [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/) could help.
