## Challenge

I write a lot about lessons I've learned. That's how I got where I am. Since teaching has helped me a lot in my career, I want you to experience the same effects. First, you have to teach yourself. For this book, my challenge is for you to teach others while you are learning. Here are a couple of tips on how to achieve it:

* Write a blog post about a specific topic from this book. It's not about copying and pasting the material, but teaching the topic your own way. Find your own words to explain the concepts, solve a problem, and dive even further into every detail of the topic. You will see how it fills your own knowledge gaps, and how it can open doors for your career in the long term.

* If you are active on social media, consider sharing some tricks you've learned from this book with your friends. You can tweet hot tips about your latest experiment from the book which may be interesting, or show off your skills in web development Facebook groups. Take quality screenshots of your progress so viewers can follow along.

* If you feel confident recording your learning adventures, share your way through the book on Facebook Live, YouTube Live, or Twitch. You might have many people following your live sessions, but you can always post the recording on YouTube afterward. It is a great way to verbalize problems and their solutions. If parts between recordings are taking longer, cut the video or use timelapse to show the highlights. Also, consider keeping bugs and mishaps in the videos, as these can be valuable learning tools for viewers who run into the same issues. These are a few tips for a quality video:

* Record the audio in your native language. English is preferable, since it will reach the largest audience.

* Verbalize your thoughts, actions, and the problems you are running into. A visual video is only part of the challenge; the other part is narrating through implementation. The production values don't need to be perfect, and the result should include all the ups and downs of your process. If you run into bugs, embrace the trouble. Try to fix the problem yourself and search online for help. Speak about the problem, and your plan to solve it. This helps others to follow your thought process.

* Check your audio before you record a long video to make sure it records clearly, and make sure the environment has acoustics that won't hinder vocal clarity. Make sure to increase the font size in your IDE or command line terminal so viewers can see any text you'd like to be featured.

* Edit the video before you put it on YouTube. Try to keep it concise for your audience, leaving out the reading passages while summarizing the steps in your own words.

You can reach out to me to promote anything you released. If your content turns out well, I may even include it with future versions of the book as official supplementary materials. I hope you accept these challenges to enhance your learning experience.
