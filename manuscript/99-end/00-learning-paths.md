# Final Thoughts

The last chapters of this book are to inspire you to apply what you've learned. So far, the book has taught you how to use GraphQL in JavaScript on the client and server-side. You used React on the client-side and Express on the server-side. On both ends you used Apollo for a sophisticated GraphQL library between both entities. However, there is plenty of room to explore the ecosystem. If you haven't completed all the exercises from the book or read all the articles, you should start with these. Otherwise, let's see what else you can do to advance your GraphQL skills.

## Further Learning Paths

You built a couple of applications in this book. While reading the chapters, you adapted the applications to apply advanced techniques (permission-based authorization), tools (GraphQL Playground) or features (GitHub commenting). Perhaps you even followed all of the exercises closely in the book. But that's not the end. There are many more features, techniques, and tools that you can apply to these applications. Be creative and challenge yourself by implementing these on your own. I am curious what you come up with, so don't hesitate to reach out to me.

We used React on the client-side and Express on the server-side. As GraphQL and also the Apollo libraries are framework agnostic, you can couple them with any other solution. If you are familiar with Angular or Vue, you can transfer what you've learned about GraphQL and Apollo for building client-side applications with these frameworks. If you are more into Koa or Hapi on the server-side, you can use these middleware libraries instead of Express as you have done in the book. The same applies for the database used for the GraphQL server application. In this book, you used PostgreSQL with the Sequelize ORM to connect your GraphQL resolvers to the PostgreSQL database. It's up to you to substitute PostgreSQL and Sequelize with something else like MongoDB and Mongoose. Also, the Apollo client and server libraries can be substituted with other libraries from the ecosystem. You read about them in the introductory chapters of this book. You can also use [Yoga GraphQL](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to get your GraphQL server up and running. None of the technologies used in this book are set in stone, and you can substitute of them to build GraphQL applications with JavaScript.

My ultimate recommendation would be to continue with the Apollo Server application that you  built in this book, as it's an ideal starter kit to realize your own ideas. As mentioned, you are free to substitute the technologies used under the hood, but it would be great to focus on the features for your application. Since the user management is implemented for you, you can start to add your own features.
